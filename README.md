# DESCRIPTION
The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a fun and easy-to-use tool that lets users test their knowledge on different topics like geography and programming. It’s designed to be simple and visually appealing, making it enjoyable for everyone to use.

When you open the app, you’ll see a clean and colorful interface. The background has a smooth gradient, and the quiz area is neatly designed with rounded edges and soft shadows. It looks modern and professional, yet simple enough for anyone to navigate.

The quiz works like this:  
- One question appears at a time.  
- Each question has four possible answers.  
- The answers are paired with images to make the quiz more engaging.  
For example, a question like "What is the capital of France?" will show options such as Berlin, Madrid, Paris, and Rome, with matching pictures.  

When you select an answer, the app immediately tells you if you’re right or wrong. A progress bar at the top of the screen shows how far you’ve come and motivates you to keep going.

The app is built using three main parts:  
1. **HTML**: This sets up the structure of the quiz, like where the questions and buttons go.  
2. **CSS**: This makes everything look nice. It adds colors, fonts, and spacing to make the app visually appealing.  
3. **JavaScript**: This is the brain of the app. It controls how the quiz works—showing questions, checking answers, and keeping track of progress.

This quiz is perfect for learning while having fun. Teachers can use it in classrooms, or anyone can use it to improve their knowledge on various topics. It’s also easy to expand. More questions, topics, or even extra features like timers or high scores can be added.

In short, this quiz application is a simple, interactive, and visually pleasing way to learn and have fun at the same time.
